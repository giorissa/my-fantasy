    <h1>hello, Me-fantasy!</h1>
    <p>In this page, I will tell you about the difference between manga, manhwa, and manhua. 
        On the cbr.com website it is explained that, The terms "manga" and "manhwa"  actually come from the Chinese term "manhua," which means “impromptu drawings.”
        Now, international readers use these terms to address comics that are published from a specific country: manga are Japanese comics, manhwa are Korean comics and manhua are Chinese comics.

    <p>Manhwa became popular during the 1950s to 1960s but declined due to the strict censorship laws in the mid-1960s. 
        However, manhwa became popular again when South Korea launched websites that publish digital manhwa known as webtoons, such as Daum Webtoon in 2003 and Naver Webtoon in 2004. 
        Then in 2014, Naver Webtoon launched globally as LINE Webtoon.

        Manhua are comics from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Manhua is said to have started in the early-20th century with the introduction of the lithographic printing process. 
        And manhua having a difficult time being legally published overseas. However, manhuajia began self-publishing their work on social media and webcomic platforms like QQ Comic and Vcomic.

        The point is manhwa from South Korea. If you’ve never read manhwa, don’t worry. Now’s the best time to become a manhwa reader.
        Today, we more commonly know manhwa as webtoons. If you’d like to learn more about manhwa and webtoons, Given the transition to an online format, there are several manhwa apps and readers that let you read titles. Legally, even! 
        Like with manga, there are many less-than-legal places that let you read manhwa, but let’s support the original creators. Some of these webtoon apps and reader sites let you access series for free, so there’s no excuse.
